    <h1>How to Write an Article So Basic It Hurts</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the pinnacle of minimalist content design. Black text, gray paragraphs, Arial font—because who needs personality when you have legibility, right?</p>

    <h2>Let’s Talk About Line-Height (Thrilling, I Know)</h2>
    <p>We added some extra space between the lines. Why? So your eyeballs don’t beg for mercy. You’re welcome. It’s the design equivalent of yoga pants: stretchy, forgiving, and universally accepted.</p>

    <p>Also, we capped the width at 800 pixels—because apparently, letting text span across your 4K monitor is a crime against humanity.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion? This Is Peak Web Design.</h2>
    <p>So there you have it. A blog layout so clean, so neutral, so grandma-friendly—it might actually cure insomnia. You didn’t ask for flavor. You asked for readability. And that’s exactly what you got.</p>
